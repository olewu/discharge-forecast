Title: Calibrate and run a HBV model for daily streamflow
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Thea R
Maintainer: Thea R <roksvag@nr.no>
Description: Using the HBV.IANIGLA package to calibrate a simple, hydrological HBV model for daily stremflow. Daily temperature, precipitation and streamflow data, in addition to area information about the target catchment, are used to estimate 10-12 HBV parameters. The calibrated model can next be used to simulate daily streamflow based on observed and forecasted daily temperature and precipitation.
